# Ups & Downs

## Overview
_Ups & Downs_ is a reimagining of the Milton Bradley board game _The Game of Life: Twists & Turns_. 
The goal is to create a similar overall game, but with streamlined turn-taking, more agency/control for each player, and more dynamic situations both from one turn to the next, and between subsequent game sessions. See the flow charts in `documents/` for a rough idea of the differences/changes I'm working on implementing.

## Architecture
_Ups & Downs_ is partly experimental (for me) in that it is being built on **Blazor**, but ideally it should be playable on anything that can run a reasonable browser engine. 

## Hardware
The current intended hardware spec is:
```
Raspberry Pi 5 (2GB)
1024x600 Touchscreen
Adafruit Mini Receipt Printer
```
