# Ups & Downs

## Overview
_Ups & Downs_ is a reimagining of the Milton Bradley board game _The Game of Life: Twists & Turns_. 
The goal is to create a similar overall game, but with:
* streamlined turn-taking
* more agency/control for each player
* more dynamic situations both from one turn to the next, and between subsequent game sessions

See the flow charts in the root Markdown files for a rough idea of the differences/changes I'm working on implementing.

## Architecture
_Ups & Downs_ is being built on **Blazor** -- ideally it should be playable on anything that can run a reasonable browser engine. 

## Hardware
The current intended hardware spec is:
```
Raspberry Pi 5 (2GB)
1024x600 Touchscreen
Adafruit Mini Receipt Printer
```
