# Ups & Downs

## Overview

_Ups & Downs_ is a reimagining of the Milton Bradley board game _The Game of Life: Twists & Turns_. 
The goal is to create a similar overall game, but with:

* streamlined turn-taking
* more agency/control for each player
* more dynamic situations both from one turn to the next, and between subsequent game sessions

See the flow charts in the root Markdown files for a rough idea of the differences/changes I'm working on implementing.

## Architecture

_Ups & Downs_ is being built on **WPF**.

## Hardware

The current intended hardware spec is:

```
GMKtec Mini PC
1024x600 7" Touchscreen
Mini Receipt Printer
```
